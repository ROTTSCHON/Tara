            <h1>Strong, intelligent and protective German dog.</h1>
            <p>We chose to set up a kennel because we are completely dedicated to dogs.
            Many times in our  life the dog has shown us loyalty and friendship and so we have created a passion and love for them. 
            with the necessary training and time we will be able to perfect both the quality, the appearance, the socialization, the behavior. We dedicate a big part of our activities for these dogs. 
            We want to supply the market with quality dogs and  we offer seriousness and respect in everything connected with this wonderful breed â€“ Rottweiler.
            Rottweilers are some of the smartest canines around, and they're commonly used as working and service dogs because of their high levels of intelligence and trainability.
            They are loyal pets and great companions. With the right training and socialization, a Rottweiler makes a very good family pet. The Rottweiler has a very strong bond with his family.
             A well-bred Rottweiler is calm, confident, and courageous.We  breed dogs with excellent temperament and no health problems.</p>
